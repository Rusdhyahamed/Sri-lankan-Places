                    <h4>Adam's Peak</h4><br>
                    <hr>
                    <p><br>At the summit of Adam’s Peak is a footprint cast in stone.
                         It has spiritual significance to a number of different
                          religions, however, there is currently a Buddhist monastery 
                          at the summit. To the Buddhists, the footprint is that of 
                          Buddha’s; to Christians, the footprint is Adam’s; and to
                           Hindus, the footprint is attributed to Shiva.<br><br>
                        The site is a popular place of pilgrimage, especially on
                         full moon nights. The trek to the top of the mountain to
                          see the footprint is via a steep staircase containing 
                          over 5000 steps. The trail is lined with many tea stalls 
                          and food shops which act as places of rest. Most people 
                          begin their hike at 2:30 am to reach

                    <h4>Mirissa</h4><br>
                    <hr>
                    <p><br>Mirissa is the ultimate Sri Lankan beach getaway.
                         The beautiful long beach is flanked by tall
                          overhanging palm trees and lined with modern 
                          restaurants and hotels. The restaurants have
                           western style food at Sri Lankan prices. 
                           Just off the beach is Parrot Rock. It has
                            a small staircase leading to the top that 
                            offers great views of the ocean and coastline.<br><br>
                        Day trips from Mirissa include whale watching,
                         snorkeling and surfing. Weligama, just a few 
                         kilometers from Mirissa, is one of the best
                          beaches in Sri Lanka to learn surfing. 
                          Come happy hour and into the evening, 
                          many the restaurants turn their venues into
                           beach clubs and pump out drinks and tunes.

                    <h4>Nine Arch Bridge</h4><br>
                    <hr>
                    <p><br>One of Sri Lanka’s most iconic sights is the Nine Arch Bridge in the small
                         mountain town of Ella. This viewpoint offers 
                         spectacular panoramas of the surrounding area,
                          which is made up of verdant greenery and tea
                           fields.<br><br>
                        Visitors can watch trains roll over the bridge 
                        as they make their way along the Demodara Loop.
                         Constructed in the early days of the railway
                          expansion in Sri Lanka, the bridge is particularly 
                          impressive because it is made of cement, stone 
                          and brick, without the use of any steel.

                    <hr>
                    <p>Sri Lanka is famous for its tea. What better place to learn
                         more about tea than the source itself: Nuwara Eliya.
                          With a temperate climate and elevation of 1,900
                           meters (6,100 feet), Nuwara Eliya is the 
                           country’s tea production capital.<br><br>
                        You can tour a tea plantation and see how tea is
                         made. Founded in the 19th century, this hill 
                         country town soon became a retreat for British
                          colonists, earning the nickname Little England.<br>
                        April is a good time to visit, when visitors flock
                         here to see the blossoms and celebrate Sri Lanka
                          New Year. Other sights include Lake Gregory and 
                          Laxapana, Sri Lanka’s most famous waterfalls.

                    <hr>
                    <p><br>The beautiful Ravana Falls are used for bathing in the hot
                         summer months. In the rainy season, the water flow is exceptionally
                          strong and is an impressive sight. The falls are part of the 
                          Ravana Ella Wildlife Sanctuary, and the nearby cave complex
                           is rich in local legend.<br><br>
                        Conveniently located on the main road on the way to Ella town,
                         the caves are a common stop off point for visitors during their 
                         journey. Many cheeky monkeys live in the surrounding trees and
                          they are often seen on the roadside dining on fruit. However,
                           don’t let them get too close, as sometimes they can get
                            over-friendly with visitors.

                    <h4>Galle Fort</h4><br>
                    <hr>
                    <p><br>It is easy to get lost in the cobblestoned alleyways and streets
                         within Galle Fort. Today the area is full of modern restaurants, 
                         hotels, clothing, and souvenir shops. Meanwhile, snake charmers
                          and buskers line the seawall.<br><br>
                        However, the fort was not always such a cosmopolitan spot. A basic
                         fort was constructed by the Portuguese when they made their first
                          landing to the island in 1505. When the Dutch eventually seized 
                          control of Galle, they made a number of improvements; including 
                          the enormous sea wall that still lines the fort. Galle Fort is
                           an excellent example of what the synthesis between European
                            and Asian architecture looks like.

                    <hr>
                    <p><br>The Dambulla Cave Temple is a sacred Buddhist site.
                         There is no entry fee to get into the temple on full-moon 
                         days; however, these days are especially busy because of 
                         the religious significance of this lunar phase. Devotees
                          from all over the world make pilgrimage to this place.<br><br>

                        There are over 80 caves documented in the area, but the 
                        most famous five are outfitted with impressive statues 
                        and paintings. Some of the caves date back to 1000 BC, 
                        when prehistoric Sri Lankans would have lived within them,
                         so it is unsurprising that they would have created temples
                          inside at that time. If you do plan to visit, please be 
                          aware that visitors must cover their shoulders and legs
                           and remove shoes before entering the temple.

                    <hr>
                    <p><br>Sigiriya Rock Fort is utterly impressive. The rock walls rise up
                         200 meters from the ground, only to give way to a flat plateau at 
                         their summit. There are steep stairwells to reach the top and many
                          frescos to marvel at on the way up. At the top, you can find the 
                          remains of an ancient civilization, including relics of a palace 
                          and monastery.<br><br>
                        It would have taken true engineering ingenuity to build a structure 
                        at this height so many centuries ago. Around the rock fort are many
                         important caves and gardens; impressively, they are some of the 
                         first landscaped gardens in the world
